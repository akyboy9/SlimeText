TODO LIST
=========
- Intro "splash art"
--- with tagline "It's not as good as Sublime Text"
- Throw warning when invalid command is entered
- Create constant for max no. of lines?
- help command
--- ~$ h
--- displays available commands and description of their uses
- add wq command
- prevent immediate quit upon 'q' if there are unsaved changes
- enforce max character limit per line
- clear line command
--- perhaps something like ~$ c 3 to clear line 3
- copy and pasting commands?
--- ~$ cp 3 to copy content in line 3
--- ~$ ps 4 to paste clipboard to line 4
--- OR ~$ mv 3 4 to move content from line 3 to 4 (easier?)
- search and replace?
--- perhaps add on to ~$ / <...> command and prompt to replace after finding text
- look into renaming file? save as?
